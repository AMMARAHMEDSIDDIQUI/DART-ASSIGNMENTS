Q.1: Create two integer variables length and breadth and assign values then check if they are square values or rectangle values
void main() {
  int length = 5;
  int breadth = 5;

  if (length == breadth) {
    print("It's a square.");
  } else {
    print("It's a rectangle.");
  }
}
Q.2: Take two variables and store age then using if/else condition to determine oldest and youngest among them.
  void main() {
  int age1 = 25;
  int age2 = 30;

  if (age1 > age2) {
    print("Age 1 is the oldest.");
    print("Age 2 is the youngest.");
  } else if (age1 < age2) {
    print("Age 2 is the oldest.");
    print("Age 1 is the youngest.");
  } else {
    print("Both ages are equal.");
  }
}

q3:A student will not be allowed to sit in exam if his/her attendance is less than 75%. Create integer variables and assign value:
Number of classes held = 16,
Number of classes attended = 10,
and print percentage of class attended.
Is student is allowed to sit in exam or not?


void main() {
 var  classesHeld=16;
  var classesAttended =8;
  
 var attendance  = (classesAttended/classesHeld)*100;
  if(attendance>=75)
  {
    print("The student is  allowed to sit in the exam.");
  }  
  else
  {
    print("The student is not allowed to sit in the exam.");
  }
}
Q.4: Create integer variable assign any year to it and check if a year is leap year or not.
If a year is divisible by 4 then it is leap year but if the year is century year like 2000, 1900, 2100 then it must be divisible by 400.
i.e: Use % ( modulus ) operator.
void main() {
  int year = 2024; // Example year

  bool isDivisibleBy4 = year % 4 == 0;
  bool isDivisibleBy100 = year % 100 == 0;
  bool isDivisibleBy400 = year % 400 == 0;

  bool isLeapYear = isDivisibleBy4 && (!isDivisibleBy100 || isDivisibleBy400);

  if (isLeapYear) {
    print('$year is a leap year.');
  } else {
    print('$year is not a leap year.');
  }
}

Q.5  Write a program to read temperature in centigrade and display a suitable message according to temperature:
You have num variable temperature = 42;
Now print the message according to temperature:
temp < 0 then Freezing weather
temp 0-10 then Very Cold weather
temp 10-20 then Cold weather
temp 20-30 then Normal in Temp
temp 30-40 then Its Hot
temp >=40 then Its Very Hot

void main() {
  var temperature=42;
  if (temperature< 0 ) 
  {
    print("its a Freezing weather");
  }
  else if ( temperature >=0 && temperature<= 10 ) 
  {
    print("its a very cold weather");
  }
  else if ( temperature >=10 && temperature<= 20 ) 
  {
    print("its a cold weather");
  }
  else if ( temperature >=20 && temperature<= 30 ) 
  {
    print("its a normal weather");
  }
  else if ( temperature >=30 && temperature<= 40 ) 
  {
    print("its a hot weather");
  }
  else  
  {
    print("its a very hot weather");
  }
}

Q.6: Write a program to check whether an alphabet is a vowel or consonant.
void main() {
  var alphabet='l';
  if (alphabet=='a' ) 
  {
    print("its a vowel");
  }
  else if ( alphabet=='e') 
  {
    print("its a vowel");
  }
  else if (alphabet=='i' ) 
  {
    print("its a vowel");
  }
  else if (alphabet=='o' ) 
  {
    print("its a vowel");
  }
  else if ( alphabet=='u' ) 
  {
    print("its a vowel");
  }
  else  
  {
    print("its a consonant");
  }
}
Q.7: Q8: Q9????
Q10: Write a program that takes three numbers from the user and prints the greatest number & lowest number.
